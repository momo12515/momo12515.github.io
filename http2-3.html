            <h2>The Pursuit of Performance: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3</h2>
            
            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>HTTP/2: Multiplexing and Solving HOL Blocking</h3>
                <p>A new bottleneck was introduced by HTTP/1.1's dependence on the persistent connection approach: the unsuccessful pursuit of pipelining disclosed a crucial constructive modification known as **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking**. In this scenario, because the server was required to send responses in the same order as the requests, a single slow or large response could delay all following requests waiting in the queue on that connection, severely impacting performance.</p>
                
                <p>The first significant update to the protocol in almost twenty years was **HTTP/2**, formally defined in RFC 7540 in 2015. Massively influenced by Google's experimental SPDY protocol, HTTP/2's key innovation was **multiplexing**.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Multiplexing</strong> allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received simultaneously over a single TCP connection. This eliminates the HOL blocking issue at the application layer, as a slow response for one request no longer holds up others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>HTTP/3 and QUIC: Re-Architecture of the Transport Layer</h3>
                <p>The transition to **HTTP/3** performed the most serious change in the protocol's history, gripping it elsewhere from its TCP-based infrastructure to a new shipment layer built on **QUIC** and **UDP**. This change was not purely an additional improvement, but a crucial re-architecture designed to solve the persistent problem of head-of-line blocking once and for allâ€”this time, at the transport layer.</p>
                
                <p>By moving to UDP and implementing connection management within QUIC, HTTP/3 ensures that if one data stream (request/response) gets stalled, it does not affect the delivery of other independent streams on the same connection. This paradigm variation also adjusts protocol modernization, allowing for more rapid iteration and deployment of new features from the application layer.</p>
