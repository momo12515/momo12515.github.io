            <h2>Key Concepts of the HTTP Protocol</h2>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>1. The Client-Server Model</h3>
                <p>This is the fundamental concept upon which HTTP functions. A client, usually a web browser, will start a request, and a server will then respond with either a failure message or the requested data. The entire interaction is initiated by the client, which determines the target of the HTTP request via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>2. HTTP Messages: Request and Response</h3>
                <p>The exchange of data is carried out through HTTP messages, which can be classified as either client requests or server responses. An alternative set of headers, a blank line, and a noncompulsory body make up the arrangement that both have in common. The request begins with a opening line that enumerates the request method, the objective URL, and the HTTP version.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>3. HTTP Methods (Verbs)</h3>
                <!-- Code Comment: Using a description list (dl) would also be suitable here, but using headings/paragraphs for clarity. -->
                <p>The request method defines the applicable capability the client wishes to perform on the resource. The most common methods include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieves data from the server (read-only).</li>
                    <li><strong>POST:</strong> Sends data to the server to create a new resource or submit form data.</li>
                    <li><strong>PUT/DELETE:</strong> Methods for modifying or removing resources (introduced in HTTP/1.0 successors).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>4. Headers and Metadata</h3>
                <p>Metadata is set up via headers for a message, such as the content type or caching instructions. The separation of headers from the message body represents a powerful abstraction: headers administer the metadata of the communication, while the body encompasses the actual data being transported. This distribution makes HTTP a generic data transfer agreement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>5. Head-of-Line (HOL) Blocking</h3>
                <p>In HTTP/1.1, HOL blocking occurs when the successful pursuit of pipelining fails. Since the server was required to send responses in the same order as the requests, a single slow or large response could delay all subsequent requests waiting in the queue on that connection, severely impacting performance. This was the central problem HTTP/2 was created to solve.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>6. Multiplexing</h3>
                <p>Introduced in HTTP/2, multiplexing is the ability to interleave multiple requests and responses over a single TCP connection. This allows for concurrent communication, preventing a stalled request from blocking all others, thus significantly improving page load times and efficiency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>7. QUIC Protocol</h3>
                <p>The Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol is the foundation of HTTP/3. By building a new transport layer on UDP instead of TCP, QUIC offers native multiplexing, faster connection establishment (0-RTT/1-RTT), and superior congestion control, finally eliminating HOL blocking at the transport layer.</p>
