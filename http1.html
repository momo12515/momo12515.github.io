            <h2>HTTP/1.x: Simplicity & The Critical Flaw</h2>
            
            <p>The development of HTTP was proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. The original HTTP, along with HTML and the first web server, was a foundational component of his "global hypertext project."</p>

                <h3>HTTP/0.9: The Rudimentary Origin</h3>
                <p>The protocol's first adaptation, HTTP/0.9, was abnormally transparent, supporting only a single method (GET) and revolving only plain HTML documents. This directness was a premeditated architectural decision that enabled rapid adoption. The original web was conceived as a distributed, read-only document system, akin to a decentralized file system.</p>
                <p>This model contradicts strongly with the complex, interactive applications of today. The protocol's consecutive transformation, with the extension of methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE, characterized a indispensable shift away from a read-only document store-house regarding a synergetic and two-way structure.</p>

                <h3>HTTP/1.0: Formalization and Extensibility</h3>
                <p>The duration between 1991 and 1995 saw advancement, prompting the need for a formal standard. In May 1996, the first widely universal version, HTTP/1.0, was formalized as RFC 1945. This version introduced several crucial features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Versioning information within requests.</li>
                    <li>A status code line in responses.</li>
                    <li>The concept of extensible HTTP headers.</li>
                    <li>The ability to transfer documents other than plain HTML files.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Critical Performance Flaw and HTTP/1.1</h3>
                <p>Regardless of these enhancements, HTTP/1.0 suffered from a critical performance flaw: it was highly inefficient in its use of TCP connections. For every single capability request, a new TCP network had to be well-established and then sealed. This constructed considerable suspension and overhead, particularly as web pages became more complex and began to enclose various images, scripts, and stylesheets.</p>
                
                <p>This obstacle became the fundamental driver for the development of **HTTP/1.1**. HTTP/1.1 introduced the **persistent connection** approach. By keeping the TCP connection open for multiple requests, it significantly reduced the overhead associated with connection setup and teardown, marking a monumental performance improvement.</p>
